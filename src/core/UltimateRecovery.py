UltimateRecovery.py - Ultimate recovery techniques for iPhone boot recovery

This module provides aggressive recovery techniques for iPhones stuck in boot loops,
prioritizing device access over data preservation and security. These methods
should only be used as a last resort when users are willing to sacrifice data
security to regain access to their device.

WARNING: These methods may violate Apple's terms of service and could potentially
void device warranties. Use at your own risk.
