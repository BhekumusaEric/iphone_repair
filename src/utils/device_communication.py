device_communication.py - Utilities for communicating with iOS devices

This module provides functions for detecting and communicating with iOS devices
in various states (normal, recovery, DFU).

Note: In a real implementation, this would use libimobiledevice or similar
libraries to communicate with iOS devices. This is a simplified version
for demonstration purposes.
