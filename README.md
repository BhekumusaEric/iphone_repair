# iPhone Boot Recovery Tool

A comprehensive solution for recovering iPhones stuck on the Apple logo, with special focus on A12 chip devices (iPhone XS, XR and newer).

## Problem Statement

Many iPhone users experience their devices getting stuck on the Apple logo during boot, commonly known as a "boot loop." Traditional recovery methods often result in complete data loss, causing significant frustration for users.

## Our Solution

This tool provides a multi-layered approach to recovering iPhones from boot loops:

1. **Non-invasive Recovery**: Attempts to recover the device without data loss
2. **Diagnostic Analysis**: Identifies the specific cause of the boot loop
3. **Guided Recovery**: Step-by-step instructions for various recovery methods
4. **Data Preservation**: Prioritizes solutions that maintain user data when possible

## Technical Approach

- Communication with devices in Recovery/DFU mode
- Safe system file modification techniques
- Custom firmware patching for A12+ devices
- User-friendly interface for non-technical users

## Target Devices

- Primary focus: iPhone XS, XR, and newer (A12 chip and above)
- Secondary support: Older iPhone models (A11 and below)

## Potential for Apple Integration

This solution could be integrated into Apple's existing recovery tools:
- As a feature in iTunes/Finder
- As a standalone recovery application
- As part of Apple Store Genius Bar diagnostic tools

## Development Status

This project is currently in development.
